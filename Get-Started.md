Getting started with __TerasologyLauncher__ is really easy. The only pre-requisite is that you have installed *Java 7* 
(Update 6 or later) on your system. This page will give a brief guide on how to download, install, and use the launcher.

# Download &amp; Install

As of version 2.0.0 you have two possible ways of using it: (1) download the packed *ZIP file*, extract it and start the 
launcher, or (2) use the *Java Web Start* version.

## Manual Download (ZIP file)
### Step 1
Download the *ZIP file*. We recommend to use the latest release here from GitHub.

A list of all releases can be found [here](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases/). 
Nightly builds are available through our Jenkins server. 

__Note:__ *The nightly builds are for testing purposes only. We cannot guarantee for stability, and the builds are often
work-in-progress versions for the next release. Use it on your own risk!*

 of the game separately.

| Operating System          | Executable |
|-------------------------| ---------- |
| __Windows__               | `TerasologyLauncher.exe` or `bin/TerasologyLauncher.bat` |
| __Unix, Linux, Mac OS X__ | `bin/TerasologyLauncher` |
| __all__                   | `java -jar lib/TerasologyLauncher.jar` |
